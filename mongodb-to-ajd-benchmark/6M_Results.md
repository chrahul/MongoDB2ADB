## **Key Observations**

1. **AJD consistently outperformed MongoDB** in 5 out of 6 workloads across **Throughput**, **Latency**, and **Percentile Performance**.

   * Avg improvement in **throughput**: **\~21%**
   * Avg reduction in **read latency**: **\~25–35%**
   * **99th percentile latency** was lower across all workloads in AJD.

2. **Workload C (Pure Reads)** showed a near head-to-head competition — both databases performed very well, with AJD having a slight edge in latency and throughput.

3. **Workload D & E (Insert-heavy & Scan-based)**:

   * AJD performed significantly better, especially in **Scan + Read** (Workload E) where it achieved \~39% higher throughput.

4. **Workload F (RMW – Read Modify Write)**:

   * AJD handled compound operations with **28.64 ms** RMW latency compared to **38.31 ms** on MongoDB — a strong **25% improvement**.

## **Conclusion**

### Summary:

* **AJD was the better performer in 5 out of 6 workloads (83%)**.
* It consistently delivered **higher throughput** and **lower latency**, particularly under **read-heavy**, **write-heavy**, and **hybrid** workloads.
* **MongoDB performed slightly better only in raw read count under constrained scanning workloads**, but AJD remained more consistent under concurrency.

### Takeaway:

Oracle Autonomous JSON Database not only matched MongoDB in scale testing but **exceeded it in real-world hybrid workload scenarios**, especially when considering enterprise-grade scan + insert + update patterns.

> **This validates AJD as a reliable, high-performing, and cost-efficient alternative to MongoDB for scalable JSON-centric applications** — especially in regulated or mission-critical environments.
