In any MongoDB to Oracle AJD (Autonomous JSON Database) migration—especially when you're trying to **convince a customer or Oracle themselves**—the **benchmarking** is **the most critical part**.

---

###  **Why Benchmarking Is the Most Important Thing**

Because it answers the *only real question* the customer (or Oracle’s pre-sales) wants to know:

> **“Will this new solution perform as well (or better) than what I already have, without breaking my app or budget?”**

So yes — benchmarking is the *proof* that:

* AJD can handle the same workload (query volume, response times, etc.)
* There is no critical functional regression
* The cost/performance trade-off is acceptable or better

###  What Needs to Be Benchmarked (Side-by-Side)

| Area                        | MongoDB (Source)               | Oracle AJD (Target)                |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **CRUD Performance**        | Read/write latency per op type | Same using MongoDB API             |
| **Query Execution Time**    | Simple and complex filters     | Using Mongo-compatible queries     |
| **Aggregation Performance** | `$group`, `$match`, `$project` | Same through AJD API               |
| **Index Usage**             | Time to create, effectiveness  | Equivalent indexes on AJD          |
| **App Compatibility**       | Node.js/Python app response    | Does same app work without rewrite |
| **Concurrency Handling**    | 1K/5K/10K ops/sec load tests   | Use `wrk`, JMeter, etc.            |
| **Resource Usage**          | CPU/RAM on Mongo               | Auto-scaling efficiency on AJD     |
| **Cost for Load**           | Infra + Licensing              | AJD OCPU + Storage + IOPS          |

### How to Do the Benchmarking Practically

#### 1. **Sample Dataset**

* Use a standard dataset like **MongoDB’s sample airline or eCommerce database**, or a real dump from non-sensitive data.

#### 2. **Same App, Dual Config**

* Point the same app (Node.js, Python) to both MongoDB and AJD (MongoDB API endpoint).
* Test functional parity.

#### 3. **Simulated Load**

* Use tools like:

  * [`wrk`](https://github.com/wg/wrk) – high-performance HTTP load tester
  * `mongo-perf` – for low-level ops
  * `JMeter` – for UI/API workflows

#### 4. **Profiling & Metrics**

* In MongoDB: Use `system.profile` collection or `db.currentOp()`
* In AJD: Use **Autonomous Database Monitoring**, `V$SQL_MONITOR`, or **OCI metrics**

#### 5. **Cost Simulation**

* Use:

  * MongoDB Atlas pricing calculator
  * OCI cost estimator for AJD: [Oracle Pricing Calculator](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/costestimator.html)

### Suggested Output Format (Slide or Table)

> Benchmark Results: MongoDB vs AJD

| Test Type     | MongoDB Result | AJD Result | Observation                  |
| ------------- | -------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| Insert (1k)   | 135ms          | 140ms      | Comparable                   |
| Find Query    | 90ms           | 78ms       | AJD faster (index used)      |
| Aggregation   | 480ms          | 510ms      | Slight lag, acceptable       |
| Cost for Load | ₹15K/month     | ₹10K/month | AJD cheaper due to autoscale |

### Final Thought

> **Benchmarking is not a checkbox — it’s the story.**
> Show real numbers, real trade-offs, and confidence in performance. Oracle and the customer will trust you more when you **prove it, not just promise it**.
