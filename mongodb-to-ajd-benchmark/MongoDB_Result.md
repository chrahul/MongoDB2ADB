### **Insert Latency Distribution (in microseconds)**

| Percentile      | Latency (µs) |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| Min             | 440          |
| Max             | 39,551       |

| 99.99th         | 18,335       |

> Overall, the latencies are consistent and indicate that MongoDB handled the 16M insert load efficiently under the current system configuration.

---

### **Insert Failures Summary**

* **Count**: 17
* **Reason**: Duplicate key errors on `_id` field (`E11000 duplicate key error`)
* **Cause**: Likely due to:

  * Partial previous inserts not cleaned properly
  * Parallelism-related UUID/ID collision
* **Resolution**: Already handled — you dropped the DB using `mongosh` before retrying, which is correct.

---

### Observations

1. **Compared to the 6M test**, the average insert latency is nearly identical (\~3.29 ms vs \~3.25 ms), showing **good scalability**.
2. Throughput of \~3000 ops/sec is consistent and **linear with scale**, which is a **positive indicator of stability**.
3. The 17 failures are negligible (<0.0001%) and expected with massive insert workloads unless bulk-safe mechanisms or deterministic IDs are enforced.

| Metric                  | Value     |
| ----------------------- | --------- |
| Operations              | 30,053    |
| Average Latency (μs)    | 1,241.82  |
| Min Latency             | 157 μs    |

| 50th Percentile Latency | 1,014 μs  |
| 95th Percentile Latency | 2,843 μs  |
| 99th Percentile Latency | 4,971 μs  |

 **Return=OK**: All 30,053 inserts completed successfully.



####  CLEANUP

* 16 operations with **very low latency** (most < 3ms).


###  Interpretation

* This workload simulates **real-time reads of the latest records**, common in **news feeds, live dashboards, or monitoring systems**.
* MongoDB delivered **stable throughput (13.6K ops/sec)** even with 16M records.
* **Read latencies are higher than workload B**, as expected due to targeting newer entries and possible cache misses.
* **Insert latencies** remained under control — average \~1.24 ms, showing MongoDB handles mixed loads efficiently.

 **Workload E (Short Ranges)** on **MongoDB with 16 Million records**:



###  **YCSB Workload E (16M Records) – MongoDB**

** General Info**

* **Record Count:** 16,000,000
* **Operations Run:** 600,000
* **Workload Type:** Short Ranges (95% scans, 5% inserts)



###  **Overall Performance**

| Metric         | Value                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Runtime**    | 970,755 ms (≈ 970.75 sec) |
| **Throughput** | **618 ops/sec**           |
| **GC Time**    | 2,059 ms (0.21%)          |



###  **SCAN Operation (95%)**

| Metric                | Value (µs)    |
| --------------------- | ------------- |
| **Total Operations**  | 569,942       |
| **Average Latency**   | 27,106        |
| **Min / Max Latency** | 192 / 179,583 |
| **50th Percentile**   | 22,655        |
| **95th Percentile**   | 69,887        |
| **99th Percentile**   | 89,535        |

All scan operations returned **OK**.



###  **INSERT Operation (5%)**

| Metric                        | Value (µs) |
| ----------------------------- | ---------- |
| **Successful Inserts**        | 5          |
| **Failed Inserts**            | 30,053     |
| **Average Latency (Success)** | 907        |
| **Average Latency (Failed)**  | 1,341      |
| **Max Latency (Failed)**      | 57,887     |

 **Insert failures are significant** — likely due to write capacity or indexing issues during concurrent scanning.



###  **Garbage Collection (G1GC)**

| Generation     | GC Count | GC Time (ms) |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------ |
| Young Gen      | 1318     | 2,059        |
| Old/Concurrent | 0        | 0            |



###  Summary Notes:

* **Throughput** is moderate at \~618 ops/sec, which is typical for scan-heavy workloads at this scale.
* **Latency on SCAN** is quite high, especially at the 95th–99th percentile — expected due to disk I/O and memory pressure.
* **High INSERT failure count** (30K+) should be investigated. It may stem from:

  * Memory limits
  * Write concern settings
  * MongoDB configuration (`w=1` may still cause contention under heavy scan load)
* GC overhead remains minimal and non-blocking.

**Workload F Benchmark Analysis (16 Million Records on MongoDB):**




####  **Overall Execution**

* **Total Ops Run**: 600,000
* **Runtime**: `84,641 ms` (\~84.6 sec)

* **Min / Max**: `162 μs / 84,927 μs`
* **P50 / P95 / P99**:

  * 50th: `781 μs`
  * 95th: `2,247 μs`
  * 99th: `4,069 μs`
* **Return=OK**: 100%



####  **CLEANUP**

* **Ops**: 16
* **Average**: `360 μs`
* **Max**: `5,735 μs`



####  **GC Activity**

* **Young GC Count**: 126
* **Young GC Time**: `203 ms`
* **GC Time %**: `0.23%` → negligible



###  Observations:

* Very **stable performance** with >7k ops/sec throughput.
* **READs are fast**, but READ-MODIFY-WRITE naturally takes longer (\~2.7 ms avg).
* **UPDATEs are efficient**, with sub-ms average latency.
* Latency tails (95th and 99th) are within reasonable bounds—indicating good response time distribution.
* No Old GC or Concurrent GC events — excellent JVM health.
