### **Performance Metrics (Load Phase)**

| Metric                          | Value               |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Total Operations Attempted**  | 16,000,000          |
| **Successful Inserts**          | 15,999,983          |
| **Insert Failures**             | 17                  |
| **Average Insert Latency**      | **\~3.29 ms**       |
| **Insert Throughput (ops/sec)** | **3039.56 ops/sec** |

---

### **Insert Latency Distribution (in microseconds)**

| Percentile      | Latency (Âµs) |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| Min             | 440          |
| Max             | 39,551       |
| 50th percentile | 3,248        |
| 90th percentile | 5,359        |
| 99th percentile | 8,623        |
| 99.9th          | 12,863       |
| 99.99th         | 18,335       |

> Overall, the latencies are consistent and indicate that MongoDB handled the 16M insert load efficiently under the current system configuration.

---

### **Insert Failures Summary**

* **Count**: 17
* **Reason**: Duplicate key errors on `_id` field (`E11000 duplicate key error`)
* **Cause**: Likely due to:

  * Partial previous inserts not cleaned properly
  * Parallelism-related UUID/ID collision
* **Resolution**: Already handled â€” you dropped the DB using `mongosh` before retrying, which is correct.

---

### Observations

1. **Compared to the 6M test**, the average insert latency is nearly identical (\~3.29 ms vs \~3.25 ms), showing **good scalability**.
2. Throughput of \~3000 ops/sec is consistent and **linear with scale**, which is a **positive indicator of stability**.
3. The 17 failures are negligible (<0.0001%) and expected with massive insert workloads unless bulk-safe mechanisms or deterministic IDs are enforced.

**ðŸ”¹ General Info**

* **Record Count:** 16,000,000
* **Operations Run:** 600,000
* **Workload Type:** Short Ranges (95% scans, 5% inserts)



###  **Overall Performance**

| Metric         | Value                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Runtime**    | 970,755 ms (â‰ˆ 970.75 sec) |
| **Throughput** | **618 ops/sec**           |
| **GC Time**    | 2,059 ms (0.21%)          |

###  **SCAN Operation (95%)**

| Metric                | Value (Âµs)    |
| --------------------- | ------------- |
| **Total Operations**  | 569,942       |
| **Average Latency**   | 27,106        |
| **Min / Max Latency** | 192 / 179,583 |

| **99th Percentile**   | 89,535        |

âœ” All scan operations returned **OK**.



###  **INSERT Operation (5%)**

| Metric                        | Value (Âµs) |
| ----------------------------- | ---------- |
| **Successful Inserts**        | 5          |
| **Failed Inserts**            | 30,053     |

| **Average Latency (Failed)**  | 1,341      |
| **Max Latency (Failed)**      | 57,887     |

 **Insert failures are significant** â€” likely due to write capacity or indexing issues during concurrent scanning.



###  **Garbage Collection (G1GC)**

| Generation     | GC Count | GC Time (ms) |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------ |
| Young Gen      | 1318     | 2,059        |
| Old/Concurrent | 0        | 0            |



###  Summary Notes:

* **Throughput** is moderate at \~618 ops/sec, which is typical for scan-heavy workloads at this scale.
* **Latency on SCAN** is quite high, especially at the 95thâ€“99th percentile â€” expected due to disk I/O and memory pressure.
* **High INSERT failure count** (30K+) should be investigated. It may stem from:

  * Memory limits
  * Write concern settings
  * MongoDB configuration (`w=1` may still cause contention under heavy scan load)
* GC overhead remains minimal and non-blocking.
