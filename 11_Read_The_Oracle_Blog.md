# Read this blog:
[Oracle Blog: MongoDB API](https://blogs.oracle.com/database/post/mongodb-api)

## 

This blog is a great **pre-read or appendix** for your team’s POC documentation.

**key takeaways** from that Oracle blog for our POC documentation and internal reports.

#  **Key Points from Oracle’s MongoDB API Blog (for POC Runbook)**

**Reference:** [Oracle MongoDB API Blog](https://blogs.oracle.com/database/post/mongodb-api)

---

##  **1️ MongoDB API Compatibility**

* Oracle Autonomous Database (AJD) now supports **native MongoDB wire protocol**.
* Applications can continue using:

  * **mongosh**
  * **MongoDB Compass**
  * **Mongoose**
  * Any MongoDB driver

** Benefit:** No need to change application code or drivers — just update the connection string.

---

##  **2️ Seamless Development Experience**

* Developers can keep using:

  * **find()**
  * **insert()**
  * **update()**
  * **aggregation pipelines**
* Oracle AJD parses MongoDB queries and executes them natively.

** Benefit:** Application logic remains the same — easy migration path.

---

##  **3️ JSON Storage Optimized for MongoDB Queries**

* AJD stores JSON documents using Oracle’s **OSON** format.
* This allows fast:

  * Reads/writes
  * Aggregations
  * Queries

** Benefit:** Performance is comparable to MongoDB-native databases.

---

##  **4️ Hybrid Access — MongoDB + SQL**

* Once data is in AJD:

  * MongoDB queries work **unchanged**.
  * Oracle SQL can query the same data for **advanced analytics** and **reporting**.
  * Optional for future BI dashboards or enterprise reporting.

** Benefit:** Use the best of both worlds — MongoDB for app queries + SQL for analytics.

---

##  **5️ Security and Automation**

* Uses Oracle Autonomous Database features:

  * **Always-on encryption**
  * **Automatic backups**
  * **Automatic scaling and patching**
* Wallet-based secure connections (**ca.pem** and other files).

** Benefit:** Reduced operational overhead and enhanced security.

---

##  **6️ Ideal for Gradual Migrations**

* MongoDB API allows **side-by-side testing**.
* Applications can connect to both MongoDB and AJD during migration.
* Supports **gradual rollout** or **hybrid use**.

** Benefit:** Low-risk migration with flexible cutover timing.
