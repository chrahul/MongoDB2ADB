# Day 10: Final Migration Blueprint (Customer-Facing)

---

## Objective:

To consolidate everything from **Day 1 to Day 9** into a **clear, professional, customer-facing document** that outlines your:

* Migration approach
* Tools and process
* Discovery insights
* Architecture
* Execution steps
* Validation results
* Post-migration plan

This blueprint can serve as:

* Internal delivery documentation
* A reference for future migrations
* A presentation for Oracle/customer teams

---

## Recommended File Name:

`mongodb-to-ajd-blueprint.md` or `MongoDB_AJD_Migration_Blueprint.pdf` (after final polishing)

---

## Suggested Structure for the Blueprint

You can structure the final report like this:

---

### 1. Executive Summary

* Overview of the migration
* Why this migration was done
* Expected business and technical benefits
* Target architecture (Oracle AJD)

---

### 2. Source Workload Overview

| Detail            | Info                    |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| MongoDB Version   | 4.4 / 5.x               |
| Deployment Type   | On-prem / Atlas         |
| Total Collections | xx                      |
| Data Size         | xx GB                   |
| Index Count       | xx                      |
| App Stack         | Node.js / Python / Java |

---

### 3. Target Environment

| Detail         | Info                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Oracle DB Type | Autonomous JSON Database       |
| Version        | 23ai                           |
| Region         | OCI India West / US East       |
| Storage        | Auto-scaling                   |
| Access         | SQL Developer Web, Mongo shell |

---

### 4. Migration Strategy

* Selected Oracle PMG 4-phase approach
* Tools used: `mongodump`, `mongoexport`, `DBMS_CLOUD`, `Oracle External Tables`, Compatibility Advisor
* Method: JSON flat file export + External Table loading
* Target Indexes recreated manually

---

### 5. Migration Plan Summary

| Phase       | Activities                                         |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Planning    | Discovery, stakeholder alignment, workload mapping |
| Preparation | Setup AJD, backup Mongo, define migration tools    |
| Execution   | Export, transform, load data                       |
| Validation  | UAT, query tests, performance checks               |

---

### 6. Compatibility Analysis

**Tool Used:** MongoDB Compatibility Advisor
**Summary:**

* Compatibility: 97.5 percent
* Unsupported Operators: `$mapReduce`
* Adjustments made in app layer where needed

---

### 7. Testing and Validation

* Record counts matched
* UAT scripts passed
* Query latency improved by 25 percent
* Index effectiveness reviewed
* No data loss or corruption

---

### 8. Post Migration Observations

* System stable after 5 days
* Auto-scaling working as expected
* Monitoring set up with OCI alerts
* Security audit passed (Oracle Vault enabled)

---

### 9. Risks and Lessons Learned

| Risk                                 | Mitigation                  |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| `$lookup` aggregation not compatible | Flattened schema beforehand |
| JSON nesting depth                   | Pre-validated with advisor  |
| Missed index types                   | Manual recreation with SQL  |

---

### 10. Appendices

* MongoDB export command used
* SQL script for table creation
* Advisor output sample
* AJD Wallet instructions
* Diagram of data flow (optional image link)
