#  MongoDB to Oracle AJD Migration – Day 1 & 2 Summary

---

##  **Day 1: Getting Started – Purpose, Audience, and Scope**

---

###  Objective

To understand the purpose of the official Oracle migration guide, identify who should read it, and the scope of what it covers.

---

###  1. **Purpose Statement**

The Oracle MongoDB Migration Guide outlines the:

* **Stages** of migration
* **Processes and methods** for JSON data movement
* Target: **Oracle Database 23ai**
* Assumes technical knowledge of **MongoDB** and **Oracle**

---

###  2. **Intended Audience**

This guide is meant for:

* Migration teams
* Database Administrators (DBAs)
* Data Architects / Engineers
* Application Developers
* Partner solution teams
* Anyone exploring **MongoDB workload migration to Oracle**

---

###  3. **Disclaimer (Important!)**

* The guide is **informational only**
* It is **not** legally binding or part of Oracle’s contractual obligations
* Oracle may change features or behaviors described here at any time

---

###  Summary in One Line:

> *“This is a technical, advisory document designed to guide teams through migrating JSON data from MongoDB to Oracle 23ai, using Oracle’s MongoDB API interface.”*

---

##  **Day 2: Oracle Converged DB – The Big Picture**

---

###  Introduction: The Problem with Single-Purpose Databases

####  Challenges:

* Companies use different databases for different data types (JSON, Spatial, Time-Series)
* This causes:

  * **Data Silos**
  * **High Complexity**
  * **Duplicate Efforts**
  * **Security risks**
  * **Harder maintenance**

---

###  Oracle’s Solution: **Converged Database**

A **Converged Database** is Oracle’s answer:

* Supports **JSON, SQL, IoT, Spatial, Machine Learning**, and more
* Allows **multiple workloads on one engine**:

  * OLTP
  * Analytics
  * AI/ML
  * Document-store
  * Blockchain

This reduces:

* Number of tools needed
* Points of failure
* Integration issues

And improves:

* **Developer agility**
* **Operational efficiency**
* **Security and compliance**

---

###  Executive Summary: The Shift Back to Oracle

####  *Why customers left Oracle earlier:*

* They needed NoSQL-style agility
* Oracle lacked native JSON/document APIs

####  *Why they’re coming back now:*

* Oracle DB 23ai now includes:

  * Full **MongoDB-compatible JSON API**
  * **High-performance JSON querying**
  * **Autonomous infrastructure**
  * **Enterprise-level analytics, SQL, and AI**

###  Oracle’s Migration Framework (PMG Method)

Oracle defines **4 key phases** for MongoDB migration:

| Phase              | Description                                                             |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Planning**    | Define goals, assess source systems, identify stakeholders              |
| **2. Preparation** | Set up the Oracle target, test compatibility, prepare tooling           |
| **3. Execution**   | Migrate objects, data, and app code using native tools or Oracle DB API |
| **4. Validation**  | Post-migration tests, performance monitoring, data integrity validation |

> *Each phase can be used independently depending on customer need.*

### 📊 Summary Table

| 🔍 Concept             | 💡 Explanation                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Problem**            | Multiple databases → silos, integration mess                       |
| **Solution**           | Oracle Converged DB (JSON + SQL + everything)                      |
| **Tech Match**         | MongoDB devs can still use same drivers                            |
| **Advantage**          | One DB for all workloads (OLTP, Analytics, ML, etc.)               |
| **Migration Approach** | 4-phase PMG Model: Planning → Preparation → Execution → Validation |
