# MongoDB Foundations

This folder contains foundational learning content and setup steps for the **MongoDB to Oracle Autonomous JSON Database (AJD) Migration Lab**.

It is designed to help you build a solid understanding of MongoDB concepts before transitioning to hands-on migration activities. Each file in this folder walks through key MongoDB topics, setup runbooks, and Oracle integration preparation steps.

## How to Use

1. Start from file `01` and work your way down.
2. Follow each runbook carefully and try to execute commands in your lab.
3. Use files `08` to `13` as transition points into Oracle setup and migration readiness.
4. This module prepares you for executing the full MongoDB to AJD migration using the Oracle Database API for MongoDB.
