* **Option 1** → mongoexport/mongoimport (cross-cloud POC)
* **Option 2** → replica set (same-cloud production)

##  **mongoexport/mongoimport vs. Loading into Replica Set**

| Method                               | Description                                                                              | Pros                                                  | Cons                                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **mongoexport/mongoimport**          | Export collections to JSON or CSV, then import into AJD                                  | Easy, simple, best for POCs and small-medium datasets | Slightly slower for very large data sets                  |
| **Loading into MongoDB Replica Set** | Set up AJD *as a secondary/replica* to an existing MongoDB replica set, so it syncs data | No downtime, continuous sync, handles large data      | Complex setup, requires replica set and more admin skills |

---

##  **What Oracle is saying**

In Oracle’s **advanced migration documentation**, they suggest for **live production migrations**:

> "Add AJD (with MongoDB API) as a secondary member in your MongoDB replica set so it syncs automatically."

That is an **advanced, near-zero downtime approach**, useful when:

* You want **ongoing replication** from MongoDB to AJD.
* You cannot afford any downtime.
* Your MongoDB is already in a **replica set configuration**.

---

##  **For Your POC (Best Choice)**

Since:

* You have **standalone MongoDB** (not a replica set).
* You want a **quick POC, not a live sync**.
* You have manageable data (\~75-100 MB for now).

**mongoexport/mongoimport is the best path** — easy, fast, and fully sufficient.

---

##  **Bottom Line**

| If...                                         | Then use...                 |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| You want simple, quick POC                    | **mongoexport/mongoimport** |
| You want complex, no-downtime production sync | **Replica Set sync to AJD** |

 **For now — mongoexport/mongoimport** is exactly what you need.

---

##  **Now — mongoexport Commands (Step 1)**

Here’s how to export your collections from MongoDB:

```bash
mongoexport --db salesdb --collection customers --out customers.json
mongoexport --db salesdb --collection products --out products.json
mongoexport --db salesdb --collection orders --out orders.json
```

This will create three files:

* **customers.json**
* **products.json**
* **orders.json**

All will be in your current directory.

**Tip:** If you want to keep them in a folder:

```bash
mkdir exports
mongoexport --db salesdb --collection customers --out exports/customers.json
mongoexport --db salesdb --collection products --out exports/products.json
mongoexport --db salesdb --collection orders --out exports/orders.json
```

 **That’s it — your data is ready for import to AJD after this.**

##  **Loading into MongoDB Replica Set — When it Makes Sense**

**Replica Set Syncing** (where you add AJD as a replica) is mainly useful when:

* **Your MongoDB is already running inside OCI** (or connected via fast private network).
* You need **ongoing replication** or **near-zero downtime migration**.
* You are moving **large datasets** (TB scale) and want to avoid export/import delays.

**Key point** → Setting up a **replica set across cloud regions or between Azure and OCI** is:

* **Technically possible** but
* **Complex**, high latency, and usually **not worth it for cross-cloud POCs**.

---

##  **Your Current Scenario**

| Parameter                    | Status                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| MongoDB hosted on            | **Azure VM**                          |
| AJD will be                  | **OCI**                               |
| Private fast link available? | Not yet (unless you set up VPN/DRG) |
| Size of data                 | \~100 MB (easy for export/import)     |
| Downtime tolerance           | OK for POC                            |

 **Conclusion** → **mongoexport/mongoimport** is much simpler and the right choice.
Replica set syncing would only add unnecessary complexity here.

##  **When to Consider Replica Set Migration**

* **MongoDB already running in OCI** (on Compute, OKE, or Marketplace AMI).
* **Very large databases** (1+ TB).
* **Production cutover** with minimal downtime.
