Perfect. Let’s move ahead with **Day 6** of the MongoDB → Oracle AJD Mastery, focusing on:

---

# ✅ **Day 6: Stage 1 – Planning Phase Deep Dive**

---

## 🎯 Objective:

To master the **Planning Phase** of the migration process by:

1. Conducting effective discovery sessions
2. Mapping existing MongoDB workloads
3. Defining goals, constraints, and strategy

---

## 🧭 Step-by-Step: Stage 1 — Planning

---

### 🔹 1. Define Goals

Ask: *Why are we migrating this MongoDB workload to Oracle AJD?*

| 🎯 Common Goals                   |
| --------------------------------- |
| Cost reduction                    |
| Platform consolidation            |
| Need for SQL/analytics on JSON    |
| Better security & compliance      |
| Autonomous infrastructure         |
| Scalability and high availability |

---

### 🔹 2. Identify Stakeholders

List roles who will participate:

| 👥 Role                  | 💼 Involvement                    |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Application Dev          | Validate app behavior             |
| DBA                      | Source/target DB expertise        |
| Cloud Architect          | OCI provisioning & infra          |
| Business Owner           | Approves goals/ROI                |
| Security/Compliance Lead | Validates PII controls, IAM setup |
| UAT Team                 | Final validation                  |

---

### 🔹 3. Conduct Discovery Workshop

Use this checklist during your stakeholder sessions:

#### 📋 Sample Discovery Questions (From Appendix 1)

---

#### 🏢 Business

* What are the **business drivers** for the migration?
* Do you have **executive sponsorship**?
* What is the **timeline**?
* Who will **own implementation**?
* What are your **cloud adoption levels**?

#### 🧠 Technical

* What is your **existing MongoDB architecture**?
* How large is your **data volume**?
* Are there **complex data models** (nested JSON, polymorphic data)?
* What are your **HA/DR requirements**?
* Any preferred **Oracle technologies**?

#### 🗃️ Database

* How many **collections** (schemas) are there?
* Are there **indexes** that must be preserved?
* Any **license renewals** to consider?

#### 💻 Application

* What is the **application stack** (Node.js, Python, Java)?
* Any use of **MongoDB-specific features** like `$lookup`, `$merge`, `$graphLookup`?
* Is the workload **multi-tenant**?
* Any **ETL scripts, reports, pipelines** that use Mongo?

#### 🧪 Testing

* What are your **acceptance criteria**?
* What is your **UAT plan**?
* Do you have **test datasets** available?

#### 🚀 Deployment

* Do you plan a **pilot rollout** or full cutover?
* Do you need a **fallback** plan?
