#  What is MongoDB?

MongoDB is a **NoSQL, document-oriented database** that stores data in **JSON-like documents** (called BSON internally). It's built for **flexibility, scalability, and speed**, especially in modern web/mobile/cloud applications.

#  High-Level MongoDB Architecture

```plaintext
Client Applications
       |
MongoDB Drivers (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.)
       |
MongoDB Server (mongod process)
       |
Data Storage Engine (WiredTiger, etc.)
```

Let’s break this down:

---

##  Key Components of MongoDB

### 1. **Document Store (Collections & Documents)**
- MongoDB stores data in **collections** (like tables).
- Each collection contains **documents**, which are **BSON** (Binary JSON) objects.
- Documents can have **flexible schemas**, meaning different documents in the same collection can have different structures.

```json
{
  "name": "Rahul",
  "email": "rahul@example.com",
  "tags": ["oracle", "cloud", "mongodb"]
}
```

---

### 2. **MongoDB Server (`mongod`)**
- The core database daemon process.
- Handles all requests: reads, writes, indexes, queries.
- Manages in-memory caching and disk I/O using a **storage engine** (typically WiredTiger).

---

### 3. **Drivers / Client Libraries**
- Apps connect to MongoDB using **drivers** (like Node.js, Java, Python).
- Drivers translate app queries (like `find()`, `insert()`) into **MongoDB wire protocol**.
- MongoDB uses a **binary protocol**, not REST or SQL.

---

### 4. **Query Engine**
- Supports rich **query language** with filters, projections, and aggregations.
- Example: `db.orders.find({status: "shipped"})`

---

### 5. **Indexing**
- Indexes improve query performance.
- Supports **single-field, compound, geospatial, and text indexes**.

---

### 6. **Replica Set**
- MongoDB’s built-in **high availability mechanism**.
- A **replica set** consists of:
  - 1 Primary (read/write)
  - N Secondaries (read-only, backup/failover)
- Replication ensures data durability and failover.

---

### 7. **Sharding (Optional)**
- Enables **horizontal scaling** by partitioning collections across multiple shards (nodes).
- MongoDB balances data based on **shard keys**.

---

### 8. **Storage Engine**
- Default: **WiredTiger** (supports compression, caching, concurrent reads/writes)
- Handles how data is written to disk and managed in memory.

##  How MongoDB Handles Operations

| Operation | What Happens |
|----------|---------------|
| `insertOne()` | Driver sends BSON to server → server writes to memory + disk |
| `find()` | Query is parsed → optimized → run against indexes/data |
| `updateOne()` | Target document located → modified in memory → persisted |
| `deleteMany()` | Matching docs removed → replication ensures consistency |

---

##  Key MongoDB Strengths

- Flexible, schema-less data model
- Fast for read-heavy and write-heavy workloads
- Horizontal scalability (sharding)
- Built-in high availability (replica sets)
- JSON-native programming model (easy for developers)
